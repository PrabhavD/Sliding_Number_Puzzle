# 9 piece Sliding Number Puzzle

All files and commits were planned and created within 4 hours.

### Major Steps Left:
- Debugging -> game logic works on paper but is still prone to errors when running on browser
- Implement checking algorithm that makes sure that randomly generated array actually has a valid solution
- Add animations to moving tiles

### Instructions:
- Click on tiles that can move to adjacent empty space
- Goal is to have all numbers in ascending order starting from top left with empty cell at the end (bottom right tile)
